  Use the animation shortcode to show an After Effects animation, powered by
  Lottie. The Lottie library supports animations that have been exported as JSON
  with Bodymovin. The animation uses vector graphics and is responsive. The
  shortcode is a simplified wrapper of the Lottie library that provides basic
  functionality.
